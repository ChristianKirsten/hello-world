# hello-world
My first ever Git repository
Aged 48, being a director in a vibrant logistics solutions company,
I was wondering whether this is all or what could add to my extensive
business knowledge so I have fun working in this company for the next
20 years.
So taking data science courses appears to be a good option to move 
ahead into the future... :-)
